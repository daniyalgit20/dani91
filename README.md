 **Introduction:**
 In the era of digital finance and banking, Automated Teller Machine called as ATM in its short 
form playing a vital as well as essential role in providing convenient and efficient banking services 
to the millions but to trillions of people in the world. As the advancement in the technology and 
finance, this project presents in depth information and knowledge of ATM machine or its program 
using Dev C++ compiler in the integrated development environment
 **Software Used:**
 We have used Dev C++ compiler to run this program. we can also use visual studio code and other 
C++ compilers etc.
 **Dev C++ Compiler:**
 The Dev C++ compiler is famous, Open source, integrated development (IDE) for C++ and as 
well as for C Programming languages. It provides user friendly interface and a robust set of 
features tailored for software developers as per their need and requirement, making an excellent 
choice for both beginners and experienced programmers. Developed by Bloodshed Software, Dev 
C++ compiler is designed to run on windows operating systems and offers powerful tool for 
writing, compiling, debugging and executing C and C++ programs
 **Enhancements in code:**
 Will use all concepts in the code which we studied after mid exams like inheritance, composition 
and aggregation etc
